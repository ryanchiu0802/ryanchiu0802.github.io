A simple HTML based Minesweeper game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Playable demo: http://vincentchen.me/works/minesweeper/index.html**

* Use CSS/HTML to create the classic Windows Minesweeper game UI.
* Use JavaScript to implement game logic.
* Tutorial:
  - Click left mouse button to uncover a block.
  - Click right mouse button once to place a flag mark, click right mouse button twice to place a question mark, click right mouse button three times to clear all marks.
  - Click middle mouse button on any uncovered block to perform a quick uncovering for surrounding blocks.

* Tested on Chrome, other browsers are not guaranteed.
* This game is modified from a very old code base I wrote in 2005.
  - Original version (only support IE7 or earlier): http://vincentchen.me/works/NixMine/index.html
  - Currently implementation is still not good, I will keep refactoring it.
